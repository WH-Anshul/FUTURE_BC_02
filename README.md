# Task 2: Set Up Your First Crypto Wallet  

## Task Description  
This task required setting up a **MetaMask** wallet, securing it, and exploring its key features to understand how decentralized wallets work in the blockchain ecosystem.  

## Approach  
I chose **MetaMask** as my crypto wallet due to its ease of use and compatibility with multiple blockchains. The process involved:  

1. Downloading and installing the **MetaMask** extension  
2. Creating a new wallet and securely backing up the **Secret Recovery Phrase**  
3. Adding **SepoliaETH test tokens** using a **faucet**  
4. Exploring different wallet functions, including sending and receiving tokens  
5. **(Additional Learning)** Creating and adding my **own test token named "Polygon"**  

## Key Features Explored  
- **Wallet Creation & Security**: Setting up MetaMask and securing the **Secret Recovery Phrase**  
- **Network Management**: Switching between Ethereum Mainnet and Sepolia Testnet  
- **Adding Custom Tokens**: Importing testnet tokens, including my **own ERC-20 test token "Polygon"**  
- **Transaction Execution**: Sending test ETH to another wallet and verifying transactions  
- **Exploring Wallet Balances**: Understanding how tokens are stored and displayed  

## Key Learnings  
- How **self-custodial wallets** work in a decentralized ecosystem  
- Importance of **private keys and seed phrases** for wallet security  
- Adding **custom ERC-20 tokens** to MetaMask  
- Understanding **testnet transactions** and **gas fees** on Ethereum
